# Agent Test POC
Agent Test is a Computer User Agent (CUA) experiment exploring the possibility of using natural language processing to author and execute unit tests.  The repository utilizes [Browser-User](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) as an underlying dependency with Azure hosted ChatGPT4.0.  Consumers may author tests in TOML documents using natural language instructions.
